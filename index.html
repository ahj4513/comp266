		<h2>About the bicycle path system of South Korea</h2>
		<p>South Korea's Cross Country bike paths are a network of bike paths that consist of existing bike paths, re-purposed low-traffic agricultural roads, and decommissioned railroad infrastructures. Decommissioned train stations are repurposed as museums and rest areas. </p>
		<p>South Korea's network of bike paths stretch from North to South and West to East. The system is subdivided into regional sections:
		<ul>
			<li>ARA Bicycle Path (Incheon)</li>
			<li>HANGANG (riv.) Bicycle Path (Seoul Section) </li>
			<li>NAMHANGANG (riv.) Bicycle Path (Seoul-Chungju)</li>

		<h2>Certification System</h2>
		<p>There is something that makes these bicycle paths a little bit more special. You don't just ride on these paths. There is a certification system which uses decommissioned telephone booths as unmanned certification booths with stamps inside. Also called, "certification passports," Bike passports are sold at certification centres for 4,000 KRW along the bicycle path system. </p>
