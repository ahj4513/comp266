		<h2>Bicycle Rentals</h2>
		<p>You may not want to bring your bicycle to Korea whether it is due to the hassle of checking the bicycle in at the bag check or due to your fear of damaged bicycle before/during/after the tour.</p>
		<p>If you wish to rent a bicycle while in Korea consider the following options presented below.</p>

		<h2>Bicycle type recommendation</h2>
		<p>
			While it is possible to complete your touring goal with any type of bicycle, there are actually some recommended types I have for you. Having done the grand slam cycling tour, I noticed that, although road bicycle was plenty capable of handling more than 90% of the terrain without any issues, I found that the vibration fatigue does add up over time. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Mountain bikes would be the most ideally geared for Korean uphills, but they are a bit slow with large rolling resistance on the flats. If you want a more upright riding position and higher vibration dampening, you should ride a mountain bike. 
		<p>
			On the other spectrum, you have road bicycles (aero frames, lightweight climbing frames, and endurance frames). These bicycles vary in gear ratios, so you want to ensure that your lowest gears (smaller diameter chainring (aka front gears) and larger diameter casette (aka rear gears)) are as close to 1:1 ratio as possible. Although gear ratios can be somewhat close to 1:1 and the bikes tend to be lightweight, you get to feel every bump on the road because of the tire and fork set up. Road bicycles usually do not come with suspensions, so it will give you more fatigue at the end of the journey.
		</p>
		<p>
			My recommendation is actually somewhere in the middle. I think the best type of bicycle to embark on this journey with is a <strong>gravel bike</strong>. A gravel bike in layman's terms is basically a road bike bones (frameset) with mountain bike skins (tires). Gravel bikes allow the rider to be more aerodynamically positioned, increasing the average speed and general effort when cruising on flat courses. Gravel bikes are also meant for light trail use, meaning they come with gear ratios suitable for climbing high grade uphills. The tires are wider, with more all-terrain focused tread pattern, giving the user more cushioning against terrain-induced vibrations. Another advantage of using gravel bikes is that frames are usually designed with bikepacking in mind, which means there will be mounting points for bicycle-mounted storage bags. For longer trips, you want to lower the center of gravity as much as possible because higher center of gravity results in a less-stable bike when manoeuvering. Therefore, choosing a gravel bike will definitely enhance your overall experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another viable option is a folding bike. A folding bike has significant speed and climbing effort disadvantages due to the weight and wheel diameters. Even with these disadvantages, I can recommend folding bikes because of the fact that you can more freely use public transportation. Like it's mentioned in the transportation page, folding bikes do not restrict you in any way when traveling in trains, subway cars, buses, and ferries. You can simply put your bike into the folded position and it's acceptable to ride in any mode of transportation without the fear of being denied boarding. This additional layer of freedom of movement is why I can also recommend folding bikes as an alternate type of bicycle, even though it requires more effort and is slower in general. The additional consideration to make when choosing to start the tour with a folding bike is to plan for more days than you would for a road or gravel bike.
		</p>

		<p>
			In summary, the speed of travel for different types of bikes is as follows (in general, lower numer is better): (1) Road Bike, (2) Gravel Bike, (3) Hybrid Bike, (4) Mountain Bike, and (5) Folding Bike. The level of terrain-induced fatigue is as follows, in ascending order (Lower number is better): (1) Mountain Bike,  (2) Gravel Bike, (3) Hybrid Bike / Folding Bike, and (4) Road Bike. The ease of intercity movement (via public transport) is as follows, in ascending order: (1) Folding Bike, (2) Road Bike / Gravel Bike, and (3) Mountain Bike / Hybrid Bike (due to flat handlebars).
		</p>

		<p>
			There is always the option to go on the tour with an electric bike, but it takes away the fun in my opinion.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you find this recommendation section useful in choosing the right bike for your needs.
