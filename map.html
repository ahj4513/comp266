			Gyeong-ln ARA waterway that brings West Sea and HANGANG (riv.) together, are located side by side.</p>
		<p>Unlike most other bicycle path made by paving a weir or connecting already existing streets, 
			ARA Bicycle Path is designed to be a road for cycling only from the beginning, allowing the road 
			to be straight without any sharp curve or hill. There are also a number of perfect places for riders 
			to relax on the way.</p>

		<h3>HANGANG (riv.) Bicycle Path (Seoul Section)</h3>
		<p>Seoul is the heart of Korea and Hangang (riv.) is the aorta penetrating the heart. Hangang (riv.) 
			has been flowing together with 600 years history of Korea's Capital, Seoul, and it also has been 
			the land mark of Korea.</p>

			the 'miracle of Hangang (riv.)' was born is ever more dynamic and touching at the same time.</p>
		<p>Skyscrapers and 24 bridges of Hangang (riv.) pass by as pedals are worked, and ferries and yachts 
			of gorgeous colors on the river will not let riders eyes off of them. Sceneries of the sunset and 
			night views of Hangang (riv.) make the Thames of London or the Seine of the Paris color-less.</p>
		<h3>NAMHANGANG ( riv.) Bicycle Path</h3>

			of Namyangju, Yangpyeing, Yeoju, Wonju, Chungju and finishes its 132km of journey at Chunju

			museum. Plus, Ipobo, Yeojubo and Gangcheonbo add on to the picturesqueness of the Namhangang (riv.).</p>

			railroad runs through tunnels and by the riverside, meeting anamnestic whistle stops that are 
			now serving as rest stops on the way.</p>

			the Bongan tunnel of 260m length. This is where Mugunghwa used to run through to get to the 
			famous Jeongdongjin station from old drama 'Sandglass'. Now the whistle of the train is gone, 
			but the smooth curve of the tunnel greets with the light when bikes come in a line like the 
			train used to.</p>
