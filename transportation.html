			<h2>Taxi</h2>
			<p>You should be able to tap-to-pay using your own credit card, but you can try the Pop cards on the taxis. They should accept it in most areas if not all. If you are calling a taxi, make sure you call a van because you have a bicycle. Sedan taxis will most likely deny your boarding.</p>
			<p>Kakao T taxis are recommended when you have to take taxis. You can book van taxis through the Kakao T app. Foreign credit cards are also accepted as methods of payment, which is another advantage of using the Kakao T app. Moreover, your taxi fare is set in a very straightforward manner. You can see your destination and route while you are being driven to your destination, so there is no worrying about being over-charged.</p>

		<h2>Bicycle considerations on Bus / Train / Subway</h2>
		<p>In this section, I will provide you with some basics of accessing public transit system with a bicycle.
		<br>If you have a folding bike, you can ride on the subway lines 1-9 with the bike in the folded position.
		<br>If you have a regular Mountain bike or a road bike, you can only ride the subway with your bicycle on Saturdays, Sundays, or Statutory holidays. If you wish to ride on the subway outside of these designated days, you need to have your bike inside a bike bag and well out of the way of the paths of other passengers. 
		</p>
		<p>If you wish to travel by intercity or express bus to your destinations of interest, you need to first ensure that there is a luggage compartment. If there are a lot of luggages due to high volume of travelers, your boarding may be denied (you may need to wait for the next bus and hope it isn't accommodating passengers with luggages). Still, this will be your most reliable method of travel aside from Van taxis or ferries (which can almost always accommodate travelers with bicycles).</p>
		<p>Trains are more tricky to board with a bicycle. You need to stow your bicycle in a bicycle carrying bag or a bike bag so that it is considered a luggage item. After that, you need to ensure that you have a place to store your larger than usual luggage item. There is one type of train that accommodates bicycles, but it is very hard to come by. It is called ITX-CheongChun. It is useful if you wish to go from the city of Chuncheon (in Gangwon Province) to Seoul.</p>
